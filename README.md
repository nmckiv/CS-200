# CS-200
Team project from fall 2023 UA CS-200 curriculum

------Overview------

ChocAn software program for CS200 Software Engineering and
Design class for Fall 2023. Over the course of the semester, we completed the
Requirements (Project 1), Analysis (Project 2), Design (Project 3), and
Implementation and Testing (Project 4) phases of the Software Development
Lifecycle (SDLC). The project implemented Secure and Agile Software
Development processes. Project 1 – 4 assignments can be viewed under the
Assignments folder. Solutions for Project 1 – 3 can be viewed via each
Report.html file. Each of these Projects contain an HTML_PNGs folder, an Individual Reports folder, a Support_HTMLs folder, and their respective reports. The final software program can be run by the JAR under the
release folder in Project 4.

------Project 1 - Requirements------

Project 1 - Requirement's report contains our header and task distribution tables, a short paragraph explaining what this project is for, all of the repository commits made during this phase, as well as the following artifacts: a glossary for terms related to the project, a use case diagram along with descriptions for each use case, a story selection matrix, and 2 generic security user stories.

------Project 2 - Analysis------

Project 2 - Analysis's report contains our header and task distribution tables, a paragraph detailing what the system requires to operate, all of the repository commits made during this phase, as well as the following artifacts: a main activity diagram, activity diagrams for each of the use cases we found, and a stereotype class diagram.

------Project 3 - Design------

Project 3 - Design's report contains our header and task distribution tables, 2 paragraphs detailing the cohesion and coupling of our design, as well as proposing the architecture type we felt was best for this project and why, and all of the repository commits made during this phase. this report also contains the following artifacts: Sequence diagrams for every use case and a class diagram.

------Project 4 - Implementation and Testing------

Project 4 has a handful of folders. Doc contains the javadoc detailing our code, Header contains the report html with our header file, TaskDistribution contains the report with our task distribution table, Manual contains a user manual for our program, release contains the jar file to run our program, and src contains our source code. within src, there are 2 packages. Software contains all of our java and fxml files, while Tests contains all of our unit testing.
